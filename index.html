          <h1>Phillip Schofield Confirms Rumors</h1>
          <p>This was not meant to be on television. </p>
			<p>Holly, and This Morning co-host Phillip Schofield, promptly pulled on patterned headgear for the 43-year-old Italian's cooking segment on Monday's show.</p>
			<p>Gino announced he was cooking up a meatball feast as he fronted the segment, complete with a white bandana with blue stripes.

He matched this to his blue shirt as he began to whip up the warming feast.

Yet far from offering their wholehearted support for his new look, the presenters wreaked havoc.

They brandished the headgear towards the end of the ITV daytime show and Phil helpfully tied Holly's blue accessory behind the back of her head.</p>
		<p>He quizzed Gino: "So this is a new essential, is it?"

Holly then continued: "I dont' know whether you can see it but on you head you have a bandana."

As Phil started to tie one onto her own blonde locks she said: "Ah is it going on here, I guess it is."

Chuffed by her similar look, Gino said: "Ah you see, we are starting to work together."

</p>
		<p>Holly continued to probe the reasons for Gino's quirky look, and said: "See what, what does this give me? "I guess from a cleanlines point of view of not dropping hair ..." before he bluntly replied: "Don't you think it's cool?"

Phil, meanwhile, chose a grey and white headband to better match his slate grey shirt.

As she was attaching it to his head, Holly squealed: "You should have gone blue, you are not going to see this on your hair, it's the same colour!"

</p>
		<p>The cook has been Stateside filming ITV's Gordon, Gino and Fred: The American Roadtrip.

He revealed: "This is what I looked like most of the filming time. I want to grow my hair and it was very hot there so the only solution that I had is that someone sold these bandanas and I wanted to put them on my head so I could keep cool."

Gino also discussed how now sees himself in the "third stage" of his life and plans to return to Sardinia in Italy and breed horses.
